# SubLeq

This is an older project - a subleq in python - single instruction CPU implementing  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer#Subtract_and_branch_if_less_than_or_equal_to_zero,


It has a compiler, tests and the processor.
This code needs some work:

- Python 3 conversion
- Documentation on how to use it

Things I'd like to try:

- Try to get a working stack code running inside the subleq
